# ConnectSocial

**A private, self-hosted social network for your company or team** — a Facebook-style platform where employees post updates, share images, comment, and react, all behind your own login with role-based access, content moderation, and activity monitoring built in.

## 🖥️ Self-hosted

ConnectSocial is designed to run on your own machines — see [Getting Started](#-getting-started) to run it locally in ~5 minutes.

## ✨ What it does

ConnectSocial replaces public group chats and email threads with a dedicated, **private** internal network:

- **Company-wide or department-scoped posts** — share updates with everyone or with a team (Engineering, Marketing, Sales, HR, Finance…)
- **Comments & reactions** — `like`, `love`, or `wow` any post or comment, with live counts
- **Image sharing** — attach images to posts via a validated, magic-byte-checked upload endpoint
- **Rich profiles** — avatar, job title, bio, department, and a public profile page showing each person's posts, comments, and reaction stats
- **Notifications** — a bell with an unread counter, pushed in **real time over WebSocket** when something new happens
- **Content moderation** — anyone can report a post/comment; Moderators get a queue and can dismiss the report or resolve it (optionally deleting the content)
- **Admin monitoring** — SuperAdmins see analytics overviews, per-day activity trends, a full audit timeline, per-user activity history, and an engagement leaderboard
- **Role-based access control** — four clearly separated roles (see below) enforced on both the API and the UI

### Roles & permissions

| Role | What they can do |
| ---- | ---------------- |
| **SuperAdmin** | Everything: manage users & departments, view analytics/monitoring, moderate reports, delete any content |
| **Moderator** | Review and resolve/dismiss reports, delete any post or comment |
| **RegularUser** | Create posts/comments, react, upload images, manage their own content and profile |
| **Guest** | Read-only access to the feed and profiles (must still be logged in) |

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) 18+
- [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com) 8 (local or remote)

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Configure the backend

```bash
cd backend
cp .env.example .env
```

At minimum, generate a strong JWT secret and paste it into `.env` (the backend **refuses to start** if `JWT_SECRET` is missing, shorter than 32 chars, or still the placeholder):

```bash
openssl rand -base64 48
```

Create the database (TypeORM creates the tables automatically in dev mode):

```sql
CREATE DATABASE connect_social CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci;
```

### 3. Run both apps

```bash
npm run dev
```

- Frontend: **http://localhost:3000**
- Backend API: **http://localhost:3001** (WebSocket at `ws://localhost:3001/ws`)

Outside production the backend seeds demo accounts and sample content (only if the database is empty):

| Username | Password | Role |
| -------- | -------- | ---- |
| `admin` | `password` | SuperAdmin |
| `moderator` | `password` | Moderator |
| `user` | `password` | RegularUser |
| `guest` | `guest123` | Guest |

Log in as **`admin` / `password`** to explore the full admin, monitoring, and moderation experience.

These are public credentials. Seeding is **disabled automatically when
`NODE_ENV=production`**, and can be forced either way with `SEED_DEMO_DATA`
(`true` to always seed, `false` to never seed). A production instance gets its
first account from `BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_*` instead — see step 5 of the deployment
guide below.

## 🔌 API overview

Base URL: `http://localhost:3001` — every request (except login) requires `Authorization: Bearer <JWT>`.

| Method & path | Description | Access |
| ------------- | ----------- | ------ |
| `POST /auth/login` | Log in, returns JWT (rate-limited to 5/min) | Public |
| `GET /auth/profile` | Current user's profile | Any authenticated user |
| `GET/POST /posts` · `GET/PATCH/DELETE /posts/:id` | Posts CRUD; list supports `?departmentId=` & `?scope=` | Read: all roles · Write: RegularUser+ |
| `GET/POST /posts/:postId/comments` · `DELETE /comments/:id` | Comments | Write: RegularUser+ |
| `POST /posts/:id/react` · `POST /comments/:id/react` | Toggle a reaction | RegularUser+ |
| `POST /reports` | Report a post/comment | RegularUser+ (10/min) |
| `GET /reports` · `PATCH /reports/:id/resolve` · `PATCH /reports/:id/dismiss` | Moderation queue | SuperAdmin, Moderator |
| `GET /notifications` · `GET /notifications/unread-count` · `PATCH …/read` · `PATCH /notifications/read-all` | Notifications | Authenticated (own only) |
| `GET /monitoring/overview` · `/timeline` · `/activity` | Analytics & audit trail | SuperAdmin |
| `GET /monitoring/top-users` | Engagement leaderboard | Authenticated |
| `POST /messages` · `GET /messages/conversations` · `GET /messages/with/:ref` · `POST /messages/with/:ref/read` | Direct messages (kept 60 min, then deleted) | RegularUser+ to send · all roles to read own |
| `GET /messages/unread-count` · `GET /messages/retention` | Badge count + retention policy | Authenticated (own only) |
| `GET /messages/admin/conversations` · `GET /messages/admin/thread` | Management monitoring of conversations (reads are logged) | SuperAdmin |
| `POST /uploads` | Upload an image (PNG/JPG/GIF/WebP, ≤5 MB) | RegularUser+ |
| `GET /ws?token=<JWT>` | WebSocket — live events | Authenticated |

**Realtime events** (received over the socket as JSON): `notifications:new` is pushed to all connected users when a new post is created; `reports:count` is pushed to Moderators/SuperAdmins when the pending queue changes.

## 🔐 Security features

- **bcrypt password hashing** — with an automatic upgrade path: accounts still storing legacy plaintext passwords are re-hashed on their next successful login
- **Enforced `JWT_SECRET`** — startup fails fast if the secret is missing, weak, or a placeholder
- **Role checks on every admin endpoint** — `SuperAdmin`/`Moderator` routes are guarded server-side, not just hidden in the UI
- **Rate limiting** — global defaults plus stricter limits on `/auth/login` and `/reports`
- **Upload validation** — image content is verified via magic bytes, not just the declared MIME type
- **Security headers** — Helmet on the API (CSP configured in `next.config.js`)
- **Authenticated reads** — anonymous access is closed; even read-only Guests must log in
- **E2e security test suite** — see [Testing](#-testing)

---

## ☁️ Deployment

### Overview

ConnectSocial ships with a production Docker Compose stack — MySQL 8, the NestJS
API (REST + WebSocket), the Next.js frontend and Caddy for automatic HTTPS —
that runs for **$0** on a free always-on VM. Everything is served from a single
HTTPS origin:

```
https://<your-domain>
├── /api/*      -> NestJS API + WebSocket hub (the /api prefix is stripped)
├── /uploads/*  -> NestJS (uploaded post images)
└── /*          -> Next.js frontend (next start)
```

The app needs a long-running process (WebSocket hub) and a persistent disk
(uploaded images), which is why it is deployed to a small VM rather than a
serverless or scale-to-zero platform.

### 0. Try the production stack locally (optional)

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# in .env: DOMAIN=localhost, NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost/api,
#          CORS_ORIGIN=http://localhost
docker compose up -d --build
```

Then open `https://localhost` — Caddy creates a local certificate for
`localhost`, so the browser warns once. (Use HTTPS; Caddy redirects from HTTP.)

### 1. Create the free server

Oracle Cloud's **Always Free** tier includes a permanently free VM (Ampere ARM,
2 OCPU / 12 GB RAM, ~200 GB of storage):

1. Sign up at <https://www.oracle.com/cloud/free/>. A card is required for
   identity verification; Always Free resources are never charged.
2. Create an instance: image **Ubuntu 24.04**, shape **VM.Standard.A1.Flex**
   (2 OCPU / 12 GB), 100 GB boot volume, and add your SSH public key.
3. If creation fails with "Out of host capacity", try another availability
   domain — or the always-free AMD micro shape (1 GB RAM; add 2 GB of swap).
4. Note the instance's public IP.

### 2. Open ports 80 and 443

Both layers are required on Oracle:

- **VCN security list** — Networking → Virtual Cloud Networks → your VCN →
  Subnet → Security Lists → Add Ingress Rules: source `0.0.0.0/0`, TCP 80 & 443.
- **Instance firewall** — Oracle's Ubuntu images drop everything except SSH:

  ```bash
  sudo iptables -I INPUT 6 -m state --state NEW -p tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT
  sudo iptables -I INPUT 6 -m state --state NEW -p tcp --dport 443 -j ACCEPT
  sudo netfilter-persistent save
  ```

### 3. Point a free domain at the server

Create a subdomain at <https://www.duckdns.org> (say `connectsocial`) and set
its IP to the instance's public IP. Verify from your own machine:

```bash
dig +short connectsocial.duckdns.org
```

DNS must already resolve to the server before the first start, because Caddy
requests a Let's Encrypt certificate on boot.

### 4. Install Docker and start the stack

On the server:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com | sudo sh
sudo usermod -aG docker "$USER" && newgrp docker

sudo mkdir -p /opt/connectsocial && sudo chown "$USER" /opt/connectsocial
git clone YOUR_REPO_URL /opt/connectsocial   # for a private repo use its SSH URL + a deploy key
cd /opt/connectsocial

cp .env.example .env
openssl rand -base64 48      # paste the output into JWT_SECRET
nano .env                    # DOMAIN, NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL, CORS_ORIGIN,
                             # DB_PASSWORD, JWT_SECRET
```

### 5. First boot — create the schema and the first account

The repository has no baseline migration and production mode never creates
tables on its own, so the **first** start runs with the `.env.example` defaults
`NODE_ENV=development` + `DB_SYNCHRONIZE=true`. That creates every table.

Because `NODE_ENV=development` would also seed the known-password demo accounts,
create the first SuperAdmin explicitly and tell the backend **not** to seed:

```bash
# in .env, for the first boot only
echo 'SEED_DEMO_DATA=false' >> .env
printf 'BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_USERNAME=admin\n' >> .env
printf 'BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_PASSWORD=%s\n' "$(openssl rand -base64 24)" >> .env

docker compose up -d --build
docker compose ps                 # wait until api and mysql report healthy
curl -s https://YOUR_DOMAIN/api/health
docker compose logs api | grep -i 'initial SuperAdmin'   # note the password it used
```

The backend creates exactly one SuperAdmin with that password (or, if the user
table is not empty, nothing at all). Then switch to production behaviour so
later starts never mutate the schema or seed anything:

```bash
sed -i 's/^NODE_ENV=.*/NODE_ENV=production/; s/^DB_SYNCHRONIZE=.*/DB_SYNCHRONIZE=false/; s/^DB_MIGRATIONS_RUN=.*/DB_MIGRATIONS_RUN=true/' .env
docker compose up -d
```

### 6. Remove the bootstrap password

Delete `BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_PASSWORD` (and `BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_USERNAME`) from `.env`
and `docker compose up -d` again. It is only read when the user table is empty,
but it should not sit in the environment — treat it like any other secret.

If you deliberately ran with `SEED_DEMO_DATA=true`, the demo accounts exist:
create real accounts with the right roles, then deactivate `moderator`, `user`
and `guest`. Changing a password or deactivating an account takes effect on the
**next request** (sessions are re-validated server-side and revoked through
`tokenVersion`), so you do not have to wait for tokens to expire.

### 7. Verify the deployment

- `https://YOUR_DOMAIN` loads with a valid certificate, and plain HTTP redirects.
- Login, posting, commenting and reacting all work.
- Open the app in two browsers: a new post in one shows the live toast and bell
  badge in the other (WebSocket through Caddy).
- Uploading an image returns an `https://…/uploads/…` URL that renders in the feed.
- `docker compose restart api`, then reload — the uploaded image is still there.

### Operating the deployment

```bash
docker compose ps               # status + health
docker compose logs -f api      # follow logs (caddy / web / mysql too)
docker compose up -d --build    # apply updates after `git pull`
docker compose down             # stop; data stays in the named volumes
```

**Backups** — `deploy/backup.sh` dumps the database and archives the uploaded
images into `./backups` (7-day rotation by default):

```bash
crontab -e
15 3 * * * /opt/connectsocial/deploy/backup.sh >> /var/log/connectsocial-backup.log 2>&1
```

Copy those archives off the machine (`scp`, `rclone`, …) — a backup that only
exists on the server is not a backup. Certificates live in the `caddy-data`
volume and renew automatically.

### Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause |
| ------- | ------------ |
| No certificate / HTTPS handshake fails | DNS not pointing at the server yet, or port 80 blocked — check `docker compose logs caddy` |
| `502` from Caddy | `api` or `web` still starting or crashed — `docker compose ps`, then `docker compose logs api` |
| API up but "table doesn't exist" | First boot was skipped — redo step 5 |
| Uploaded images don't render | `TRUST_PROXY` must be `1` behind Caddy (it is by default) |
| Live notifications never arrive | Socket path is `/api/ws`; check the browser console and `docker compose logs caddy` |
| Changed `DOMAIN`, app still calls the old URL | `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` is compiled in at build time — `docker compose up -d --build web` |

### Cost

$0 — Oracle Always Free VM, DuckDNS subdomain, Let's Encrypt certificates and
Docker are all free. Optional extras that cost money: a custom domain, or a
second free VM / off-site storage for backups.

### Manual (non-Docker) alternative

```bash
cd backend  && npm install && npm run build && npm start     # port 3001
cd frontend && NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:3001 npm run build && npm start
```

Set the backend environment variables manually (see `backend/.env.example`) and
put a reverse proxy in front of both. The Compose runbook above is what this
repository tests and supports.

---

## 🧪 Testing

The backend ships an end-to-end security test suite (Jest + Supertest) that boots the real app against a throwaway `connect_social_test` database:

```bash
npm run test:backend
```

The suite expects MySQL on `127.0.0.1:3307` (adjust `backend/test/env.ts` to match your setup) and drops/recreates the test schema on every run.

---

## 🗺️ Roadmap

- Pagination for feeds and comments
- TypeORM migrations (replace `synchronize` in production)
- Notifications for comments/reactions on your posts; email digests
- Search & hashtags
- SSO / SAML integration and audit export
