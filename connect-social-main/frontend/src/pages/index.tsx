    question: 'What can each role do?',

      'Guests can read and follow along. Regular users can post, comment and react. Moderators can review reports and remove content that breaks the rules. Super admins manage users, departments and access, and can see platform activity.',

    question: 'Who can see what I post?',
    answer:
      'Posts published to \u201cAll Company\u201d are visible to every signed-in member. Posts published to a department are only visible to that department\u2019s members — plus moderators and admins, who help keep the feed safe.',

  {
    question: 'Is my data private?',
    answer:
      'Yes. Every post, comment and reaction is behind a login on your company\u2019s own deployment — content never goes to a public feed, and department posts stay within their department.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How do reports work?',
    answer:
      'If a post or comment feels off, any member can report it in one click. The report lands in the moderation queue, where moderators and admins review it and resolve or dismiss it — removing the content if needed.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What should I share?',
    answer:
      'Anything your team benefits from: company announcements, project milestones, helpful questions and celebrations. If it keeps your colleagues in the loop, it belongs on the feed.',
